# Therian Feature Extraction

To run the feature extraction script, you must first install NodeJS and Radare2.

Upon doing so, clone this repo, navigate into it and run

`$ yarn install`

`$ yarn bundle`

`$ node therian-extractor.js -i input.exe -o output.json`

More documentation will be added as we see fit.

You can also go into github actions and download the latest `therian-feature-extractor` artifact instead of doing the build on your own machine.
